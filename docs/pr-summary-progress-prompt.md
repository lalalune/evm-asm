# Progress-assessment instructions for the PR-summary agent

evm-asm tracks per-PR progress against a kernel-checked registry
(`EvmAsm/Progress.lean`) rendered to `PROGRESS.md`. The deployment
pre-step has already computed a deterministic delta and inserted it
above under "Computed progress delta for this PR". Use those numbers
verbatim — do not recompute or infer them from the diff.

## Output shape

Emit a top-level section titled exactly `## Progress assessment` at
the **end** of the PR summary. The section is short, factual, and
narrates what the computed delta means in the project's vocabulary.

If the computed delta shows no count changes and no tier transitions,
write exactly:

    ## Progress assessment

    Metric-neutral PR (no tier transitions, no count deltas).

Otherwise, include up to four bullets covering:

- **Tier transitions**: list every transition from the computed delta
  verbatim (e.g. `SDIV: partial → proven`). Do not invent or filter.
- **Count deltas**: cite only counts that changed; omit unchanged
  ones. Keep them as numbers, not adjectives ("provenCount +2", not
  "significant progress").
- **Drift risks**: if the diff adds an `evm_<name>_stack_spec_within`
  theorem but the registry change does not mention a matching
  `_<name>_witness` abbrev in `EvmAsm/Progress.lean`, flag it as a
  drift risk. The deterministic gate in `scripts/check-progress.sh`
  catches `PROGRESS.md` drift, but theorem-without-witness is a
  registry-completeness issue the gate does not catch.
- **Obligation mapping**: when a tier transition advances one of the
  9 guest-program obligations from `PROGRESS.md` ("Role in the
  L1-zkEVM stack" section), say so explicitly (e.g.
  `Advances obligation #5: full opcode coverage`). At most one
  obligation per bullet.

## Statement-strength review (spec quality ONLY — never correctness)

> Steering Phase 4, R-B3 / D5. This is the **one** place the LLM adds
> signal the kernel cannot: the kernel proves a statement *is true*, but
> it cannot judge whether the statement is *strong enough to be worth
> proving*. Layer your judgement **only** on this question. **Never**
> opine on whether a proof is correct — the Lean kernel is the perfect,
> non-gameable oracle for that, and an LLM correctness verdict is itself
> gameable. If a theorem elaborated, it is correct. Full stop.

When this PR **adds or changes a top-level stack-spec triple** (a
`theorem evm_<name>_stack_spec[_within] …`), assess its *statement
strength* against EVM semantics and emit a single sign-off line at the
end of the Progress assessment:

    Statement-strength: <OK | REVIEW> — <≤ 1 sentence>

Mark `REVIEW` (and say which check failed) if any of these hold; else
`OK`:

- **Vacuous / over-restricted precondition.** Does the antecedent
  exclude a large, real input region so the triple is near-vacuous? The
  DIV-class trap is the canonical example: a spec quantified only over
  `b.getLimbN 3 = 0` looks proven but covers a fraction of inputs. A
  `conditional`-tier entry is *expected* to be domain-restricted — flag
  only if a `proven`-tier triple hides such a restriction, or if a
  `conditional` triple lacks a stated/`coverRef` reachable domain.
- **Incomplete postcondition.** Does it cover the full observable
  effect — **stack** (pointer advanced + result word), **memory** (if
  the opcode touches memory), **gas** (charged/bounded), and
  **halting / cycle bound** (`cpsTripleWithin N`)? A postcondition that
  asserts the stack result but silently drops gas or memory is weaker
  than the opcode's real contract.
- **Trivial / mismatched statement.** Does the triple actually model the
  named opcode, or does it restate a tautology / a renamed helper lemma?

Keep it to one line. If the PR adds no top-level triple, **omit the
sign-off line entirely** (do not write "Statement-strength: n/a"). This
is advisory review fodder for the human — it does not gate the merge and
must never contradict the kernel.

## What NOT to do

- **Do not recompute counts** from the diff. The numbers above are
  derived from the kernel-checked registry and are authoritative.
- **Do not judge proof correctness.** The kernel already did, perfectly.
  Your statement-strength note is about the *spec*, not the *proof*.
- **Do not editorialize** ("major step forward", "significant
  improvement", "well done"). Stay factual.
- **Do not duplicate** the existing `Mathematical Formalization` /
  `Proof Completion (sorries removed)` / `Infrastructure` sections
  the workflow already produces. The Progress assessment is a
  *quantitative* commentary on top of those.
- **Do not flag tier downgrades** as failures. A `proven` → `partial`
  transition might mean a generalization is in progress and the
  spec has been deliberately weakened. State the transition;
  don't judge it.
- **Do not invent obligation mappings.** If you cannot point at a
  specific obligation number from `PROGRESS.md` for a given change,
  skip the mapping. False mappings are worse than no mapping.

## Vocabulary reference

These terms appear in the project and the registry; use them
consistently:

- `proven` / `partial` / `execSpec` / `notStarted` — the four
  `ProofTier` values defined in `EvmAsm/Progress.lean`.
- `cpsTripleWithin N` — bounded Hoare triple over a verified RV64
  step count of at most `N`.
- `EvmWord` — `BitVec 256`; 4-limb 64-bit representation in RV64.
- `stack spec` — top-level Hoare triple over the EVM stack
  (precondition: stack pointer + EvmWord operands; postcondition:
  stack pointer advanced + EvmWord result).
- `witness abbrev` — the `_<lower>_witness := @<theorem>` declarations
  in `EvmAsm/Progress.lean` that fail elaboration if a referenced
  theorem is renamed or deleted.
- `guest program` — in this project, the RV64 ELF that runs inside an
  L1 zkVM and validates a block + execution witness (see
  `PROGRESS.md` for the 9-item obligation list).

## When to keep the section short

If the PR is a refactor, a doc edit, a test addition, an
infrastructure change, or any other change that does not move any
metric or tier, write the metric-neutral one-liner. Do not pad.
Reviewers read silence as "this PR is not about progress" — that's
the correct signal.
