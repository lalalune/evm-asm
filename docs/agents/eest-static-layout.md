# EEST Static Layout Lessons

Moved out of `AGENTS.md` to keep the agent guide compact. Load this when:

- changing `stateless_guest`, `block_state_root`, BAL replay, or EEST harness
  memory layout;
- changing static `.data` arenas used by EEST codegen programs;
- adding harness filters or cap checks for EEST stateless runs.

## Protocol Limits First

Do not pick static arena sizes from the failing fixture alone. Check the local
`execution-specs` and `execution-spec-tests` submodules first, then size or
gate from the protocol/test limit that actually constrains the data.

For BAL replay, Amsterdam does not use a fixed account-row cap. The rule is
gas-derived:

```text
bal_items <= block_gas_limit / 2000
bal_items = account addresses + unique storage keys
```

The source of truth is
`execution-specs/src/ethereum/forks/amsterdam/block_access_lists.py` plus
`execution-specs/src/ethereum/forks/amsterdam/vm/gas.py`.

This means a complete static layout is complete only relative to a declared
maximum supported block gas limit. For the execution-specs default block gas
limit of 120,000,000, the BAL item budget is 60,000. A layout sized for that
limit must cover both extreme shapes:

- many account rows, which stress `basr_*` account-record arrays and the
  top-level `bsr_*` state-change arrays;
- one/few accounts with many storage keys, which stress per-account storage
  replay arrays such as `baap_storage_desc`, `baap_storage_paths`,
  `baap_storage_delete_paths`, and `baap_storage_values`.

Do not resize only the first array that failed. Follow every index that derives
from the same count and resize the matching backing storage together.

Large static arenas can outgrow the previous linked `.data` location. When
that happens, treat the ELF memory map as part of the layout: keep linked
`.data`, fixed working-RAM anchors, public output, and `.sszscratch` disjoint.
The current 1G-cap stateless guest layout puts `.data` at `0xa3000000` and
`.sszscratch` at `0xbf500000`, both inside the verified RAM zone. Keep the
linked `.data` growth below the `.sszscratch` start and leave headroom below
`0xc0000000`.

## State Witness Caps

The `block_state_root` witness-length guard is different from the BAL row and
state-change arena caps. The witness bytes are carried in the EEST input and
searched by the MPT helpers; simply raising the guard does not allocate a larger
`.data` arena, but it can expose execution-time blowups from repeated linear
witness scans.

Before changing the default witness cap, run both the full stateless harness and
the fixed-size verdict probe on the exact frontier that motivated the change.
For example, EIP-7251 `consolidation_requests.json` selected index 138 has
`witness_len=204888`: the default 64 KiB cap gives a conservative
`bsr_fail=111`, while an experimental 256 KiB cap reaches
`EmulationNoCompleted` even in the verdict probe at 2B steps. That means the
next implementation frontier is replay/indexing performance, not only a larger
constant.

## Launch-Time Layout Compatibility

If a static layout supports only up to a chosen maximum block gas limit, the
client/harness should reject incompatible fixtures before launching the guest.
This is a layout/ELF compatibility error, not a guest proof obligation and not
a useful emulator run.

The EEST manifest should carry enough metadata, such as `block_gas_limit`, for
the shell runner to fail fast with a clear layout error. The guest may still
keep defensive checks, but they are not the primary compatibility boundary.

If a future PR needs to support blocks above the current static limit, choose
one of these approaches explicitly:

- build a larger layout and a corresponding ELF, with docs naming the supported
  maximum gas limit;
- implement streaming/chunked replay so memory scales with actual contents
  instead of worst-case gas.

For the current EIP-8037 high-block-gas frontier, see
[`docs/eest-1g-block-gas-layout-plan.md`](../eest-1g-block-gas-layout-plan.md).
It sizes the 1,000,000,000 gas target observed in `/tmp/eest-all-2026-06-03.txt`
and records the memory-map changes needed before replacing the old
`ERROR(layout)` behavior.

## Documentation

When changing these limits, update both:

- this agent note, for future implementation work;
- `docs/eest-stateless-testing.md`, for users running the harness.
