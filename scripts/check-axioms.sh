# check-axioms.sh — kernel-truth audit of the trust base behind every
# theorem the progress registry (EvmAsm/Progress.lean) classifies as
# `.proven` or `.partly`.
#
# Why this exists: PROGRESS.md historically advertised "axiom count = 0",
# but that number was produced by grepping for the literal `axiom`
# *keyword* in source (zero), which CANNOT see the trust axioms that
# `bv_decide` and `native_decide` *synthesize* per call. `#print axioms`
# (the Lean kernel's own answer) tells the truth: a solver-invoking
# `bv_decide` seals its result as `<owner>._native.bv_decide.ax_*`, and
# `native_decide` seals its as `<owner>._native.native_decide.ax_*`.
# Both rest on the native compiler path (`Lean.ofReduceBool` /
# `Lean.trustCompiler`) — see CLAUDE.md "No native_decide or bv_decide".
#
# Policy enforced here (updated 2026-06-02 — bv_decide tightened from ALLOWED
# to FORBIDDEN after the 290->0 elimination; was set 2026-06-01, see
# docs/agent-progress-steering-review.md R-C1):
#   * ALLOWED with no allowlist entry:
#       - the three classical axioms: propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound
#   * FORBIDDEN unless grandfathered in scripts/axiom-allow.txt:
#       - bv_decide AND native_decide trust axioms
#         (`*._native.{bv_decide,native_decide}.ax_*`): both seal their result
#         behind the native compiler path (Lean.ofReduceBool /
#         Lean.trustCompiler) instead of a kernel-checked proof term. Both are
#         fully eliminated; the allowlist is an EMPTY burndown — any NEW such
#         owner fails the build. (Source-level use is also blocked earlier by
#         scripts/check-forbidden-tactics.sh.)
#   * ALWAYS FORBIDDEN (never allowlistable):
#       - sorryAx, Lean.ofReduceBool, Lean.trustCompiler appearing bare,
#         and any other axiom not covered above.
#
# Allowlist keying: by the *owning declaration* (the text before
# `._native.<tactic>.ax_*`), e.g. `EvmAsm.Evm64.SDiv.Compose.sdivCode_*`,
# not the volatile `_N_M` counter — so the burndown list is legible and
# stable across rebuilds. Editing a grandfathered proof may change its
# owner set; rerun `--write-allow` (with review) if so.
#
# Scope: the 47 witness theorems referenced by the `@EvmAsm.Evm64.…`
# abbrevs in EvmAsm/Progress.lean — the proven/partly surface the
# registry claims. (A broader sweep of all of EvmAsm/ is future work.)
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-axioms.sh                # enforce; exit 1 on a new
#                                          #   forbidden (native_decide) axiom
#   scripts/check-axioms.sh --report       # print full inventory, exit 0
#   scripts/check-axioms.sh --write-allow  # regenerate scripts/axiom-allow.txt
#                                          #   from the current closure
#
# Requires a built library (oleans) so `lake env lean` imports are cheap;
# CI runs it after `lake build`.
#
# POSIX/bash; deps: lake, grep, awk, sort, comm, mktemp.

Policy: only the three classical axioms (propext, Classical.choice,

sorry are FORBIDDEN. The allowlist $ALLOW_FILE is an empty burndown.

If you ADDED a bv_decide / native_decide (or a sorry), replace it with
a kernel-checkable proof (decide / omega / bv_omega / simp /
BitVec.eq_of_getLsbD_eq). If you intentionally moved a grandfathered
proof, rerun: scripts/check-axioms.sh --write-allow  (and have the
delta reviewed — it changes the trusted base).
