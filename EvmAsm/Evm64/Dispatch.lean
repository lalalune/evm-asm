  EvmAsm.Evm64.Dispatch

  First dispatch slice for GH #106. This module defines the pure opcode-byte
  decoder used by later RV64 jump-table or branch-tree dispatch programs. It is
  stacked on the static gas table slice because both layers share the
  `EvmOpcode` identifier type.

/-- Decode one EVM opcode byte into the opcode families currently modeled in
    `EvmAsm.Evm64`. Unsupported bytes return `none`; later feature slices can
    extend this table as new opcode handlers land. -/
