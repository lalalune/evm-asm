  EvmAsm.Evm64.DivMod.Spec.N4Carry2ComposeBridge

  Bridge the two surface forms of the n=4 v5 call-addback carry2 predicate:
  the `Evm` form `isAddbackCarry2NzN4CallV5Evm` (= the `@[irreducible]`
  `isAddbackCarry2NzN4CallV5Ab` over `getLimbN`, used by the semantic chain
  #7661/#7664) implies the Compose form `isAddbackCarry2NzN4CallV5`
  (FullPathN4V5NoNopPreloopCallAddback, used by the runtime certificate
  `n4ShiftNzLaneRuntimeCertV5Native`).

  Both unfold to the same `loopBodyN4CallAddbackCarry2NzV5` if-implication over the
  windowed limbs; the Evm side just hides it behind the irreducible `Ab` wrapper.
  (The borrow predicates are already definitionally equal, so only carry2 needs a
  bridge.)  This is the last plumbing piece for the n=4 shift≠0 cert-of-shape.
  Bead `evm-asm-wbc4i.8.2.2`.
