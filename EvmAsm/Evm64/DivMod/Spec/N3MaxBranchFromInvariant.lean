  Closes the N3 selected-carry MAX-branch predicates at the canonical bltu
  pair from a *named* set of inputs:

    1. shape hypothesis: `b3 = 0` and `b2 ≠ 0` (the n=3 shape predicate),
    2. shift normalisation facts (`v.2.2.2 = 0` and `2^63 ≤ v.2.2.1`),
    3. the canonical bltu_X = false condition,
    4. an instance of `MulsubMaxC3OneOfCarryZero` at the matching input.

  The bridge `isAddbackCarry2NzN3Max_of_not_ult_c3_one_of_carry_zero` from
  `DivN3MaxOverestimate` is invoked once per outer iteration j∈{1,0}.

  Inputs (2) and (4) are not derivable from shape alone (see
  `Counterexamples.ceN1MaxLocal_c3_one_of_carry_zero_false`); they are
  the structural normalisation facts and the per-iteration Knuth-B
  reachability invariant.  Naming them explicitly here turns the N3 MAX
  bead leaves into a composition with one named gap rather than free-form
  proof obligations.

/-- N3 j=1 MAX-branch carry-2-nz at the canonical bltu_1 = false, from
    structural normalisation facts and the named c3 invariant.

    `hv3z_norm` and `hv2_msb_norm` are the structural normalisation facts
    about `fullDivN3NormV`; closing them from `b3 = 0` + `b2 ≠ 0` + shift_nz
    is a separate work-list item (shift/clz lemma).

    `hc3` is the named `MulsubMaxC3OneOfCarryZero` instance at the matching
    `(v, u-window-at-j=1)` input.  Discharging it from selected-path
    reachability is the unified MAX-path frontier — see `DivMaxC3Invariant`. -/
