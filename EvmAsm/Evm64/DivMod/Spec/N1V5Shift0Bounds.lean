  EvmAsm.Evm64.DivMod.Spec.N1V5Shift0Bounds

  Foundational bounds for the v5 n=1 **shift=0** lane.  When `(clzResult b0).1 = 0`
  the divisor `b0` already has its top bit set (`b0 ≥ 2^63`), so on the shift=0
  branch the loop runs on the copy-AU outputs `v = (b0, 0, 0, 0)`,
  `u = (a0, a1, a2, a3, 0)` with an already-normalized single-limb divisor.

  The generic per-digit invariant core (`iterN1V5_true_remainder_lt_of_v0_norm_call`)
  only needs `v0 ≥ 2^63` and `uTop < v0`; both hold trivially here (`v0 = b0`,
  `uTop = 0`).  This file provides the `b0 ≥ 2^63` fact, which is the shift=0
  counterpart of `fullDivN1NormV_limb0_ge_pow63_of_shape` (whose `b0 <<< shift`
  collapses to `b0` at shift=0).  Bead `evm-asm-wbc4i.9.1`.

/-- On the shift=0 branch (`(clzResult b0).1 = 0`) the divisor's top bit is set:
