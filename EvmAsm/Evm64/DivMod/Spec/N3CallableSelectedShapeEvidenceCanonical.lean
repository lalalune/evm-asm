  EvmAsm.Evm64.DivMod.Spec.N3CallableSelectedShapeEvidenceCanonical

  Single-instance form for the universal callbacks inside
  `N3CallableSelectedShapeEvidence`. `isTrialN3V4_j{1,0}` are by definition
  `bltu_X = …`, so they uniquely determine the bltu pair from `(a, b)`.
  This file names that canonical pair and provides lifts from a pointed
  proof at the canonical pair to the universal callback form expected by
  `N3CallableSelectedShapeEvidence.of_parts`.

  Mirrors `N2CallableSelectedShapeEvidenceCanonical` for the n=3 lane.
