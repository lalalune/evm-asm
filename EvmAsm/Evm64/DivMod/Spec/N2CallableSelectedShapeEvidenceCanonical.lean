  EvmAsm.Evm64.DivMod.Spec.N2CallableSelectedShapeEvidenceCanonical

  Single-instance form for the universal callbacks inside
  `N2CallableSelectedShapeEvidence`. The trial-witness predicates
  `isTrialN2V4_j{2,1,0}` are by definition `bltu_X = BitVec.ult …`, so
  they uniquely determine the bltu triple from `(a, b)`. This file names
  that canonical triple and provides lifts from a pointed proof at the
  canonical instance to the universal callback form expected by
  `N2CallableSelectedShapeEvidence.of_parts`.

  Downstream proofs of the public N2 wrapper only have to discharge
  `fullDivN2SelectedCarryV4` and the `mulsub ∧ overestimate` conjunction
  at the canonical bltu triple, instead of universally quantifying over
  every triple that satisfies the trial predicates.
