  EvmAsm.Evm64.DivMod.Compose.Div128V5CodeBridge

  Code-subsumption bridges for the v5 div128 composition: the full step-1
  and step-2 block CodeReqs (unions of per-instruction singletons) are
  included in `ofProg (base + div128Off) divK_div128_v5`.

  These are the `hmono` witnesses needed by `div128_v5_spec` (Div128V5.lean)
  to extend each block spec — stated over its own block code at an offset —
  to the single `ofProg`-of-the-whole-program code requirement.

  Mirror of the per-instruction `d128_v4_sub` peeling in
  `Compose/Div128V4.lean` (lines 213-238, 276-280), but bridging the
  union-of-blocks v5 step codes rather than v4's `ofProg` sub-programs.

  Bead `evm-asm-wbc4i.6.14.1` / `evm-asm-wbc4i.6.14.2` (V5.6.15a/b).
