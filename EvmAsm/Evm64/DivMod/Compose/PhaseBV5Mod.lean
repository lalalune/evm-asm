  EvmAsm.Evm64.DivMod.Compose.PhaseBV5Mod

  v5 phase-B brick (21 steps, phaseBOff → clzOff, n=1 detection path) over
  `modCode_noNop_v5`.  Mirror of `evm_div_phaseB_n1_spec_within_v4_noNop`
  (PhaseABV4NoNop.lean): phase-B doesn't touch div128, so the same version-agnostic
  instruction bodies (init1/init2/tail + addi/bne singletons) extend to the v5 code
  via the v5 block subsumption `sharedNoNop_v5_b1_mod`.  Last leaf of the v5 n=1
  preloop.  Bead `evm-asm-wbc4i.9.1`.
